Advantages
==========

Out of the Box
--------------

CCI provides an industry-leading serverless container architecture, so you do not need to create server clusters. Instead, you can create large-scale converged resource pools using the cell-based architecture. CCI also integrates network and storage services to allow you to easily deploy and run containerized workloads through the console, kubectl, and APIs.

Fast Auto Scaling
-----------------

Resources are unlimited from a single user's perspective and can be scaled in seconds, helping you cope with service changes and ensure SLAs.

High Security
-------------

CCI provides VM-level isolation without compromising the startup speed, offering you better container experience. CCI has the following security features:

-  Virtualization is supported.
-  Kernel virtualization based on secure containers provides comprehensive security isolation.
-  In-house virtualization acceleration technologies improve the virtualization performance.
