Application Scenarios
=====================

Scientific Computing
--------------------

Scientific R&D in fields such as genomics and drug development requires high-performance and high-density computing. In addition, scientific computing is generally task-based and requires quick resource allocation and release. Therefore, a low-cost computing platform with automated O&M is required.

The following CCI features make it suitable for computing in this scenario:

-  High-performance computing and network, and high I/O storage
-  Resource scaling in seconds minimizes resource consumption
-  No O&M required for clusters and servers, greatly reducing O&M costs

**DevOps/Continuous Delivery**
------------------------------

Software development enterprises need complete DevOps processes from code submission to application deployment to improve the development efficiency. DevOps processes such as continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) are generally task-based computing and require quick resource allocation and release.

The following CCI features make it suitable for computing in this scenario:

-  Automation for the entire CI/CD process, with no cluster creation and maintenance required
-  Image-based delivery, allowing for consistency between the development and production environments

Services with Fluctuating Traffic
---------------------------------

Some types of applications, such as live video, media information, e-commerce, and online education, have obvious service peaks and troughs. For these applications, resources need to be expanded rapidly during peak hours without breaking the bank.

The following CCI features make it suitable for these applications:

-  **Fast scaling**: CCI can quickly take over services from CCE to ensure uptime during peak hours.
