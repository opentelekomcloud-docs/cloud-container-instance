Overview
========

What Is CCI
-----------

Cloud Container Instance (CCI) is a serverless container engine that allows you to run containers without creating or managing server clusters.

Traditionally, to run containerized workloads, you need to create a server cluster first. In the serverless model, a cloud provider runs servers and dynamically allocates resources so that you can build and run applications without having to worry about server statuses. This model helps you improve development efficiency and reduce IT costs.

CCI uses the serverless model that allows you to directly create and use containerized workloads on the console, using kubectl, or by calling APIs, and pay only for the resources consumed by these workloads.

.. note::

   CCI is in the beta phase. To use the service, contact customer service.

Functions
---------

**One-Stop Container Lifecycle Management**

CCI allows you to run containers without creating or managing server clusters. In the serverless model, you can deploy and run workloads on the console, using kubectl, or by calling APIs, and pay only for the resources consumed by these workloads.

Architecture
------------

CCI is a serverless container service. It allows you to create large-scale converged resource pools using the cell-based architecture. It also integrates network and storage services of the cloud platform to allow you to easily deploy and run containerized workloads through the console, kubectl, and APIs.

-  CCI works with network and storage services of the cloud platform to provide robust network and storage performance.
-  The QingTian architecture with hardware and software collaboration brings ultimate performance and user experience.
-  Virtualization provides security isolation and works with in-house hardware virtualization acceleration technologies to allow you to create high-performance pods for running your workloads.
-  With unified resource management and workload scheduling, you do not need to manage clusters.
-  Capabilities, such as quick workload deployment, elastic load balancing, and fast auto scaling, can iterate services quickly.
