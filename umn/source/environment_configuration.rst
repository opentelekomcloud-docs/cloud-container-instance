Environment Configuration
=========================

Logging In to the CCI Console
-----------------------------

Log in to the CCI console and grant CCI the permissions to access other cloud services.

#. Switch to the CCI console.

#. If this is the first time you are logging in to the CCI console, click **Agree** to grant CCI the permissions to access other cloud services.

   After the permissions are granted, an agency named **cci_admin_trust** is created. You can view the agency on the IAM console.

(Optional) Uploading Images
---------------------------

The cloud platform provides the SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) service for you to upload container images to the image repository. You can easily pull these images when creating workloads on CCI. For details about how to upload images, see `Uploading an Image Through the Client <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/software-repository-container/umn/image_management/uploading_an_image_through_the_client.html>`__.

.. important::

   Currently, CCI does not support third-party image repositories.
